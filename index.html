<p>Hi! I'm Sasank, a passionate ML and cloud enthusiast.
    I'm a current graduate student, pursing my Masters in Computer Science.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Little bit about myself</h2>
<p>
I like to solve complex problems and provide impactful solutions.
I like to build ML models and use them for better use with cloud technologies.
I recently reignited my interest for web development and now I'm working on my own portfolio from scratch!
So forgive me if you see a skeletal framework, this site will revamp as time goes by!
</p>

<h2>My Skillset</h2>
<p>
I've been a programmer for 7 years now, with most of my engineering life around Computer Science.
With 3 years of professional work experience and a couple of internships, I've worked on multiple domains, including web development using MEAN stack, Database administration, Data Engineering (ETL), complex SQL & Python Programming.
I've also worked on cloud technologies, with hands-on experience in AWS Lambdas, GCP kubernetes and containerization using docker.
Here are the tools that could tell about my software expertise.
</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Languages :</b> Python, SQL, PL/SQL, Java, Ruby, C++, C, Matlab, R, Shell Scripting</li>
        <li><b>Databases :</b> SAP HANA, Oracle SQL, MongoDB, MySQL, SQLite</li>
        <li><b>Web Development :</b> HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript, jQuery, Node.js, AngularJS, React, Ruby on Rails</li>
        <li><b>Cloud : </b> Google(Run,App Engine,GKE), Docker, AWS, Microservices, Kubernetes
        <li><b>Tools :</b> Git,  Postman, SAP (BODS, SDI)</li>
    </ul>
<p>
My key interests lie in developing Machine Learning models. I've worked on several projects, dealing with Data Mining, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
I've developed a Python search engine that can search for similarity based results, like a StackOverflow search engine.
I've worked on several projects, including Disaster Tweet Analysis, Terrain Identification from Time Series Data, Histopathologic Cancer Detection, Blueberry Segmentation, Wheatgrass Segmentation.
Here are the tools that could tell about my ML expertise.</p>
<ul>
    <li> <b>Libraries :</b> numpy, pandas, sklearn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, matplotlib, seaborn, spaCy, SAM, Roboflow, supervision</li>
    <li> <b>Skills :</b> NLP, Data Mining, Deep Learning, Image Processing, Time Series Analysis, Data Visualization</li>
</ul>
